Observable Trends
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observation 1: we can clearly see that players are overwhelmingly male. However, despite their significantly creater numbers they are not the largest spenders when looking at gender data. In fact, females spend approximately 1.06 times more than males while people who did not disclose their gender spent approximately 1.11 times more than males.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observation 2: Almost 45 percent of all players are between 20 and 24 years old while somewhere between 18 and 19 percent are between 15 and 19 years old. This leads us to believe that the game is most popular among people in their late teenage years and early adulthood as together they make up almost 2/3rds of the entire player base with their combined percentage standing at almost 64 percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People between the ages of 35 and 39 are the heaviest spenders as they spend on average $3.60 per purchase. Perhaps this is an indication of more disposable income which comes as a result of job security and seniority when one is older. Coming in second are players below the age of 10 who spend on average $3.35 per purchase. Perhaps this could be explained by the fact that people falling within this age range generally do not have much value for money and this game could be a very big priority at the moment in their lives hence making them more inclined to spend.

Finally, based on spending patters, we can see that the items Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, are the most popular and profitable items. This is evident by the purchase counts and total purchases values which stand at 13 & 12 and $59.99 & $50.76 respectively.
